    <DIV id="viirs-processing-pane" class="dashboard-pane">
      Plots here are intended to show the health of VIIRS image processing and help troubleshoot any problems. Each panel presents a summary
        of events at a different system boundary and attempts to provide insight into how well the system is behaving at that point. This
        is done by comparing current performance with the average performance.
      <P>
      Along with the individual plots and tables, a single status indicator is displayed for each pane indicating overall health. These are 
      lagging indicators which work with a rolling 24-hour window. They'll stay green for a while after a problem occurs and will remain 
      red for a bit after it's been resolved.
      <UL class="fa-ul">
        <LI><I class="fa-li fa fa-star"></I> A green star indicates everything is good.</LI>
        <LI><I class="fa-li fa fa-warning"></I> A yellow triangle indicates things seem worse than usual, but not completly broken, Maybe
            there's an outtage in a portion of the system, or maybe we're on the way to/from red. The individual plots and tables should help
            determine what, if anything, is wrong.</LI>
        <LI><I class="fa-li fa fa-exclamation-circle"></I> A red circle indicates things are broken.</LI>

      This pane watches images flowing out of the product generators and into volcview, problems here indicate that the product generators are
          misbehaving. Four product generatos run, each creating the same product for each sector with sufficient coverage.

      This pane watches the queue of products waiting to be claimed by a product generator. If the queue becomes large, it indicates that the product
      generators are either falling behind, or have stopped requesting tasks.

        <DD>Once all of the required data for a given product have arrived a task will be queued. One of the four product generators will grab a product from the queue and create images for volcview. It's normal for there to be a few items in the queue when new data arrives. The thresholds here were chosen to be somewhat relaxed, but too sluggish. Starting more product generators will help speed processing if the queue consistently gets too far behind.</DD>
