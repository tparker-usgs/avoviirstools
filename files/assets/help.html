    <H1>AVO VIIRS Processing</H1>
    Plots here are intended to show the health of VIIRS image processing. Each panel describes events at a different system boundary and
    attempts to provide insight into how well the system is behaving at that point. This is done by comparing current performance with
    the average performance over a measurement window.

    Along with the individual plots and tables, a single status indicator is displayed in each pace indicating overall health.
    <UL>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-star"></I> A green star means everything is good.</LI>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-warning"></I> A yellow triangle means things seem worse than normal, but not completly broken.</LI>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></I> A red circle means things seem clearly broken.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2 id="VolcviewImages">Volcview Images</H2>
    Images produced for display in volcview. This pane shows the health of the product generators by look at their output. We use 4
    generators that run concurerntly.
    <UL>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-star"></I>The number of images produced in the most recent 24 hours is within 90% of the daily average.</LI>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-warning"></I>The number of images produced in the most recent 24 hours is within 50% of the daily average.</LI>
      <LI><I class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></I>The number of images produced in the most recent 24 hours is less than 50% of the daily
        average.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H5 id="ImagesBySector">Images by Sector</H5>
    The typical number of images per day varies by sector. This is normal. The number of images for a given sector may also vary day-by-day.
    Again, this is normal. If a sector is way out of whack, there may be a problem.

    <H5 id="ImagesByProduct">Images by Product</H5>
    The typical number of images per day varies by product. This is normal. The number of images for a given profuct may also vary day-by-day.
    Again, this is normal. If a sector is way out of whack, there may be a problem.

    <H5 id="RecentImages">Recent Images</H5>
    This table displays the most recent images that have been created and sent to volcview. The time displayed indicates when, in UTC, the
    image was pushed to volcview.
