    Plots here are intended to show the health of VIIRS image processing. Each panel describes events at a different system boundary and
    attempts to provide insight into how well the system is behaving at that point. This is done by comparing current performance with
    the average performance over a measurement window.

    Along with the individual plots and tables, a single status indicator is displayed in each pace indicating overall health.

      <LI><I class="fa-li fa fa-exclamation-circle"></I> A red circle means things seem clearly broken.</LI>
